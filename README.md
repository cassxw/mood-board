# Destination Mood Board

A personal project for a reusable React mood board, built for the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification course. The goal is a bold, adaptable collage layout that captures my dream destinations, with interchangeable content and styling.

## Approach

- Built the UI around reusable components, so each board item can be swapped or themed with minimal edits.
- Focused on expressive typography, layered textures, and a postcard-inspired visual style without changing layout spacing.
- Refined spacing and responsiveness to preserve a 3 to 2 to 1 column flow across viewport sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React (component structure)
- HTML + CSS (layout, styling, and animation)
- JavaScript (runtime via the React bundle)
